# Service Desk Tools

## Toolset to manage day to day Service Desk Functions.

This is still in evaluation stage and is designed to experiment using various technology stacks.

### Description

Collection of tools and services that tie in different applications in use by the Service Desk and present them in a more usable and accessible format.

The application is intended to be used solely by the Service Desk and is not designed for general use in GDS.

The server is using Node (Express) to connect to various API's Web Help Desk (WHD) and Google.
The frontend is using ReactJS.

Initially the first phase looks primarily at WHD to enable quicker management of Client Assets.
